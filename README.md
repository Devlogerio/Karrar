# Iranian main battle tank: Karrar video game GDD

Note: Karrar is one of the most advanced tanks in the world, mass produced by Iran in 2017 based on Russian T90 model.

# Concept

A realistic war game in which the player is going to take control of a Karrar tank equipped with a turret cannon and a machine gun.
He/she should pass through different environment obstacles and attack enemy base that is heavily defended.
as a second game mode (defend to death): The player is going to hold the enemy back behind the forefront border as long as he can to break a record (Time of survival).

# Rules

The Karrar spawns far away from enemy.
The Karrar is able to move anywhere in the terrain freely unless the map is constraint.
The Karrar can carry a limited amount of rounds.
Supplies(rounds and HP) can be obtained by shooting supplies dropped from the sky.
The supply hit the ground, it vanishes.
Machine gun bullets are unlimited.
Each enemy has a weak spot
Out of HP means game over
Different type of cover from water to walls and trees are available
Radar shows the exact location
Shots has a drop down
Aiming is not accurate
Buildings and walls can be destructed

# Requirements
